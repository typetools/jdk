Typetools fork of the JDK
=========================

This fork of the JDK contains type annotations for pluggable type-checking.

It does *not* contain annotations for certain files (because annotations in
them cause build failures, especially in the interim builds):
 * the jdk.rmic module
 * objectweb/asm files
 * src/java.base/share/classes/java/time/*
 * src/jdk.compiler/share/classes/com/sun/tools/javac/*

There are two annotated versions of the JDK:
 * A JDK 11 version, in this directory.
 * A JDK 8 version, in directory `checker/jdk/` of repository
   https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/ .
Whenever you make a change to one, you *must* make the corresponding change
to the other.  Please make the `jdk` pull request first, and refer to its
URL in your `checker-framework` pull request.

This fork is not up to date with respect to `openjdk/jdk` (the current OpenJDK version).
This fork contains all commits through the release of JDK 11:
https://github.com/typetools/jdk/commit/da75f3c4ad5bdf25167a3ed80e51f567ab3dbd01
with commit message:
8209806: API docs should be updated to refer to javase11
[TODO: How did I determine that was the right commit to use?]

This fork is an ancestor of JDK release forks such as jdk11u.  This fork
does not compile, because the commit of `openjdk/jdk` on which it is based
no longer compiles, due to changes to tools such as compilers.
Repositories such as jdk11u and jdk12u have been updated and do compile.

This fork's annotations are pulled into those repositories, in order to
build an annotated JDK.  We do not write annotations in (say) jdk11u,
because it has diverged so far from other repositories that merging it into
jdk12u would be more painful than merging jdk into both jdk11u and jdk12u.


Pull request merge conflicts
----------------------------

If a pull request is failing with a merge conflict in `jdk11u`, do the
following in a clone of the branch of `jdk` whose pull request is failing.

```
BRANCH=`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
URL=`git config --get remote.origin.url`
SLUG=${URL#*:}
ORG=${SLUG%/*}
JDK11DIR=../jdk11u-fork-$ORG-branch-$BRANCH
JDK11URL=`echo "$URL" | sed 's/jdk/jdk11u/'`
echo BRANCH=$BRANCH
echo URL=$URL
echo JDK11DIR=$JDK11DIR
echo JDK11URL=$JDK11URL
if [ -d $JDK11DIR ] ; then
  (cd $JDK11DIR && git pull)
else
  git clone $JDK11URL $JDK11DIR && (cd $JDK11DIR && (git checkout $BRANCH || git checkout -b $BRANCH))
fi
cd $JDK11DIR
git pull $URL $BRANCH
```

Manual step: resolve conflicts and complete the merge.

```
git push --set-upstream origin $BRANCH
```

Manual step: restart the pull request CI job.

After the pull request is merged to https://github.com/typetools/jdk,
follow the instructions at https://github.com/typetools/jdk11u to update
jdk11u, taking guidance from the merge done in the fork of jdk11u to
resolve conflicts.  Then, discard the branch in the fork of jdk11u.


Qualifier definitions
---------------------

The java.base module contains a copy of the Checker Framework qualifiers.
To update that copy:

# Get version number from https://checkerframework.org/ .
VER=3.0.1
cd src/java.base/share/classes
rm -rf org/checkerframework
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/checkerframework/checker-qual/$VER/checker-qual-$VER-sources.jar
unzip checker-qual-$VER-sources.jar -x 'META-INF*'
jar tf checker-qual-$VER-sources.jar  | grep '\.java$' | sed 's/\/[^/]*\.java/;/' | sed 's/\//./g' | sed 's/^/    exports /' | sort | uniq
rm -f checker-qual-$VER-sources.jar

Copy the exports lines to src/java.base/share/classes/module-info.java


The typetools/jdk11u repository
-------------------------------

The typetools/jdk11u repository is a merge of `openjdk/jdk11u` and `typetools/jdk`.
That is, it is a fork of `openjdk/jdk11u`, with Checker Framework type annotations.

**Do not edit that repository.**
Make changes here, in the `typetools/jdk` repository.

To update jdk11u from its upstreams:
```
git pull https://github.com/openjdk/jdk11u.git
git pull https://github.com/typetools/jdk.git
```


Upstream README follows

The remainder of this file is the README from `openjdk/jdk`.
